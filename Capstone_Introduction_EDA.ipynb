    "# Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Classification Capstone Project\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Diabetic retinopathy is a diabetes-related eye disease that affects the blood vessels in the retina. It is a leading cause of blindness among individuals with diabetes. Timely detection and accurate classification of the severity of diabetic retinopathy are crucial for effective medical intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "This capstone project aims to develop a machine learning model for the classification of diabetic retinopathy severity based on retina images. The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains 15,579 retina images in JPEG format. Each image is associated with a severity score indicating the level of diabetic retinopathy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Source:** Kaggle Diabetic Retinopathy Detection dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection/data\n",
    "- **Images:** 15,579 JPEG images of both left and right eyes.\n",
    "- **Labels:** Severity scores corresponding to each image.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Dataset Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Boolean Column:** Create a boolean column indicating whether the image is from the left or right eye.\n",
    "   - **Label Matching:** Match image labels with the severity score CSV to ensure consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Image Modification\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Inversion Correction:** Identify and correct inverted images to maintain consistency.\n",
    "   - **Size Standardization:** Ensure all images are of the same size for model compatibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Distribution Analysis:** Explore the distribution of severity scores in the dataset.\n",
    "   - **Visualization:** Visualize sample images and their corresponding severity scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Model Development\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **UNKNOWN MODEL TECHNIQUE:** \n",
    "   - **Training and Validation:** Split the dataset for training and validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Model Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Performance Metrics:** Evaluate the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.\n",
    "   - **Confusion Matrix:** Analyze the model's strengths and weaknesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Conclusion and Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Summary:** Summarize project findings and model performance.\n",
    "   - **Future Work:** Discuss potential enhancements or extensions to the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial steps involve preprocessing the dataset to ensure data integrity and consistency. Subsequently, the focus is on image modification to enhance the quality and uniformity of the dataset for model development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's proceed with the implementation of these steps in the following sections.\n"
